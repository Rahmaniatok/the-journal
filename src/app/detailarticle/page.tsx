            <p>In the ever-evolving world of digital product design, collaboration between designers and developers has always been a crucial‚Äîyet often challenging‚Äîpart of the process. In April 2025, Figma introduced Dev Mode, a powerful new feature aimed at streamlining that collaboration more than ever before.</p>
                <p>üîß What Is Dev Mode?
Dev Mode is a new interface within Figma that provides developer-focused tools and removes unnecessary UI clutter that designers typically use. Instead, developers can view ready-to-implement specs, such as spacing, color values, font styles, and asset exports‚Äîwithout disrupting the design file or asking the design team for clarifications</p>
                <p>ü§ù Bridging the Gap Between Design & Development
Traditionally, handing off designs involved back-and-forth communication, misunderstandings, and occasional delays. With Dev Mode, handoff becomes real-time and seamless:
Live Design Specs: Developers can inspect the design without needing additional tools or extensions.
Code Snippets: Automatically generated CSS, iOS (Swift), and Android (XML) code help speed up implementation.
Version History Access: Stay aligned with design updates without asking for a new export every time.
Integrated Comments: Developers can leave feedback directly in the design file.</p>
                <p>üöÄ Why It Matters
For design teams working in agile environments, the speed of handoff can make or break a sprint. Figma‚Äôs Dev Mode turns a typically messy phase into a collaborative, real-time experience that reduces errors, shortens build times, and improves the designer-developer relationship.</p>
                <p>üß† Final Thoughts
Whether you're a solo designer working with freelance developers or part of a large product team, Figma‚Äôs Dev Mode introduces a smoother, smarter way to collaborate. It's not just a feature‚Äîit's a shift in how digital products are built.</p>
